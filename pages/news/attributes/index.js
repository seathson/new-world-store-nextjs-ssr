                To survive in the New World, you will have to overcome many
                difficulties and learn new abilities and skills. The development
                of each character takes place in three main areas:{' '}
                <strong>Core Attributes</strong>, <strong>Trade Skills</strong>,
                and <strong>Weapon Mastery</strong>.

            <span>
              <p className="my-3">
                When you enter the world, your character will have 5 points for
                each of the main characteristics, and this is the minimum number
                of points below which he cannot fall. Each time your character
                is promoted, you gain one attribute point, which you can invest
                in any of them. The soft lid of each of the main characteristics
                is 60 units. You can exceed the limit by using various trinkets,
                but anything above the limit has less impact on the character's
                strength. If you want to redistribute the characteristics of
                your character, you can do it at any time for a small amount of
                coins. Respec up to level 20 will be completely free, it will
                give you the opportunity to experiment.

              <p className="my-3">
                Strength governs your power with melee weapons. Heavy melee
                weapons, such as the War Hammer, scale their damage exclusively
                on Strength, while lighter melee weapons like the Sword scale
                their damage primarily on Strength, but also slightly on
                Dexterity.

                Dexterity governs the effectiveness with ranged weapons. Bows,

                Lighter melee weapons also see a benefit from Dexterity, but not

                As your skills in this group increase, the efficiency of
                resource use also grows: there is a chance to get additional
                resources while working.

                Using a weapon in battle gives experience in the corresponding
                skill of wielding this weapon, i.e. to upgrade a certain type of
                weapon, you just need to use it more often. The game has no
                restrictions on pumping weapon skills and, in theory, you can
                master all of them.

                New World has one race and no character classes, instead each
                weapon type has two Skill Trees, and each Skill Tree in turn has
                a choice of active abilities, passive modifiers and bonuses that
                are unique to that weapon type. ... Thus, your role will be
                determined by what is in your hands at the moment.
